# dsgFramework
DSG Framework is an Javascript App, and a collection of classes interfaces with HERE Maps APIs, to visualize data over maps, and to create stories. Its an effort i do on my free time. To learn and push boundaries of the technologies we create and use at HERE Maps.

To run this framework, you'll need a simple HTTP server. Navigate to the folder and Run the following command in the terminal:
	
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
